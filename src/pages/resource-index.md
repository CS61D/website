# Recommended Resources Index

Every application is different, so it is impossible to cover all of the tools one might potentially need. The core 61d curriculum covers essential building blocks which are likely to be needed in almost every full stack application, but there are many other tools and libraries that can be useful in specific situations. This page is a collection of recommended resources that can be useful in a variety of situations.

All resource recommended here generally interface well with the technologies and tools covered in the 61d curriculum.
