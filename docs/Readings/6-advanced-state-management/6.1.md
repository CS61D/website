Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called a **reducer**.

### Consolidate state logic with a reducer 

As your components grow in complexity, it can get harder to see at a glance all the different ways in which a component’s state gets updated. For example, the `TaskApp` component below holds an array of tasks in state and uses three different event handlers to `add`, `remove`, and `edit` tasks:


```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    setTasks([
      ...tasks,
      {
        id: nextId++,
        text: text,
        done: false,
      },
    ]);
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    setTasks(
      tasks.map((t) => {
        if (t.id === task.id) {
          return task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      })
    );
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    setTasks(tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== taskId));
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},
  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},
  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},
];

```

Each of its event handlers calls `setTasks` in order to update the state. As this component grows, so does the amount of state logic sprinkled throughout it.

 To reduce this complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access place, you can move that state logic into a single function outside your component, called a “reducer”.

Reducers are a different way to handle state. You can migrate from `useState` to `useReducer` in three steps:

1. Move from setting state to dispatching actions.
2. Write a reducer function.
3. Use the reducer from your component.

### Step 1: Move from setting state to dispatching actions 
Your event handlers currently specify what to do by setting state.

Remove all the state setting logic. What you are left with are three event handlers:

- `handleAddTask(text)` is called when the user presses “Add”.
- `handleChangeTask(task)` is called when the user toggles a task or presses “Save”.
- `handleDeleteTask(taskId)` is called when the user presses “Delete”.


Managing state with reducers is slightly different from directly setting state. Instead of telling React “what to do” by setting state, you specify “what the user just did” by dispatching “actions” from your event handlers.

 (The state update logic will live elsewhere!) So instead of “setting tasks” via an event handler, you’re dispatching an “added/changed/deleted a task” action. This is more descriptive of the user’s intent.

```jsx
function handleAddTask(text) {
  dispatch({
    type: 'added',
    id: nextId++,
    text: text,
  });
}

function handleChangeTask(task) {
  dispatch({
    type: 'changed',
    task: task,
  });
}

function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
  dispatch(
  // "action" object
  {
    type: 'deleted',
    id: taskId,
  });
}

```

The object you pass to `dispatch` is called an “action”. It is a regular JavaScript object. You decide what to put in it, but generally it should contain the minimal information about what happened. (You will add the dispatch function itself in a later step.)

:::tip
An action object can have any shape.

By convention, it is common to give it a string type that describes what happened, and pass any additional information in other fields. The type is specific to a component, so in this example either 'added' or 'added_task' would be fine. Choose a name that says what happened!

```jsx
dispatch({
  // specific to component
  type: 'what_happened',
  // other fields go here
});
```

### Write a reducer function

A reducer function is where you will put your state logic. It takes two arguments, the current state and the action object, and it returns the next state:

```jsx
function yourReducer(state, action) {
  // return next state for React to set
}
```
React will set the state to what you return from the reducer.

To move your state setting logic from your event handlers to a reducer function in this example, you will:

1. Declare the current state (tasks) as the first argument.
2. Declare the action object as the second argument.
3. Return the next state from the reducer (which React will set the state to).

Here is all the state setting logic migrated to a reducer function:




```jsx
function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      return [
        ...tasks,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          done: false,
        },
      ];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map((t) => {
        if (t.id === action.task.id) {
          return action.task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}
```
:::note
The code above could also be written using if/else statements, but it’s a convention to use switch statements inside reducers. The result is the same, but it can be easier to read switch statements at a glance. Also, a case should usually end with a `return`. If you forget to return, the code will “fall through” to the next case, which can lead to mistakes!
:::

### Step 3: Use the reducer from your component 

Finally, you need to hook up the `tasksReducer` to your component. Import the `useReducer` Hook from React:

```jsx
import { useReducer } from 'react';
```

Then you can replace `useState` with with `useReducer` like so:

```jsx
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks); // delete this
const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks); // and use this instead!

```

The `useReducer` Hook is similar to `useState`—you must pass it an initial state and it returns a stateful value and a way to set state (in this case, the dispatch function). But it’s a little different.

The useReducer Hook takes two arguments:

1. A reducer function
2. An initial state

And it returns:

1. A stateful value
2. A dispatch function (to “dispatch” user actions to the reducer)

If you want, you can even move the reducer to a different file:


<Tabs>
 <TabItem value="App.js" label="App.js" default>
```jsx
import { useReducer } from 'react';
import AddTask from './AddTask.js';
import TaskList from './TaskList.js';
import tasksReducer from './tasksReducer.js';

export default function TaskApp() {
  const [tasks, dispatch] = useReducer(tasksReducer, initialTasks);

  function handleAddTask(text) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'added',
      id: nextId++,
      text: text,
    });
  }

  function handleChangeTask(task) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'changed',
      task: task,
    });
  }

  function handleDeleteTask(taskId) {
    dispatch({
      type: 'deleted',
      id: taskId,
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Prague itinerary</h1>
      <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />
      <TaskList
        tasks={tasks}
        onChangeTask={handleChangeTask}
        onDeleteTask={handleDeleteTask}
      />
    </>
  );
}

let nextId = 3;
const initialTasks = [
  {id: 0, text: 'Visit Kafka Museum', done: true},
  {id: 1, text: 'Watch a puppet show', done: false},
  {id: 2, text: 'Lennon Wall pic', done: false},
];

```
</TabItem>
 <TabItem value="tasksReducer.js" label="tasksReducer.js" default>
```jsx
export default function tasksReducer(tasks, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'added': {
      return [
        ...tasks,
        {
          id: action.id,
          text: action.text,
          done: false,
        },
      ];
    }
    case 'changed': {
      return tasks.map((t) => {
        if (t.id === action.task.id) {
          return action.task;
        } else {
          return t;
        }
      });
    }
    case 'deleted': {
      return tasks.filter((t) => t.id !== action.id);
    }
    default: {
      throw Error('Unknown action: ' + action.type);
    }
  }
}

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Component logic can be easier to read when you separate concerns like this. Now the event handlers only specify what happened by dispatching actions, and the reducer function determines how the state updates in response to them.
