## Git Overview

If you write code, using git is non-negotiable. In short, git allows you to keep track of different versions of your codebase, and helps your rectify differences between these versions. You can easily restore your codebase to a previous version, or work on multiple independent features at the same time on their own branches.

## Git versus GitHub

Git is the open source version control software which you just learned how to use. GitHub a hosting provider that allows you to store your git repositories in the cloud. GitLab and Bitbucket are other popular alternatives to GitHub, although they generally have a much smaller market share.

Since git repositories are almost always hosted on GitHub, it can be easy to confuse the two.

## Git Quick Reference

**Check out the [GitHub](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf) official cheat sheets for a more comprehensive reference.**

### git init - Initialize a git repository

```bash
git init
```

### git status - Check the status of your repository

```bash
git status
```

### git add - Add files to the staging area

Files must be added before they can be committed.

```bash
git add . # Add all files in the current directory
git add file1.txt file2.txt # Add specific files
```

### git commit - Commit changes to the repository

Think of making a commit like "saving" your changes. At any point, you can revert back to a previous commit.

```bash
git commit -m "All commits must have a message"
```

### git push - Push changes to a remote repository

If your local repository is also hosted on GitHub, this will push your local changes to GitHub.

```bash
git push origin main #
```
