# JavaScript

> "Any application that _can_ be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript."

\-- Jeff Atwood, co-founder of Stack Overflow, in a [2007 blog post](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/)

> "JavaScript is the only language that I’m aware of that people feel they don’t need to learn before they start using it"

\-- Douglas Crockford, author of _JavaScript: The Good Parts_ and creator of the JSON file format

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is the only programming language which can run natively in a web browser. If you ever want to build a frontend web UI that isn't static markup, you need to know JavaScript.

There are many more options on the backend, but JavaScript is a serviceable. This means that you can kill two birds with one stone and become a fullstack developer while only learning one language.

JavaScript is an interpreted language (like python), compared to a compiled language like C++ or Java. This means that it will never have a performance ceiling as high as a compiled language, but it is more than good enough. For any small application without tens of thousands of users (a.k.a your beginner side projects), the most important factor is the speed of iteration and ease of development, which using the same language on the frontend and backend undoubtedly helps with.

## Browser versus Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript execution engine that runs outside of the browser. There are other ways of running JavaScript outside of a web browser, but the differences between them are insignificant for out purposes. The only distinction you need to think about is client side JavaScript (in the browser) versus server side JavaScript (Node.js).

JavaScript works the same way in the browser and in Node.js, but they have access to different APIs (a.k.a they can do different things) by virtue of the environment they are running in. For example, a browser application can't directly access a your device file system. Similarly, a web server running Node.js in a data center somewhere can't change your website UI into dark mode when a button is clicked.

## Basic Syntax Speedrun

:::note
61d generally assumes that you have at least a small amount of general _programming_ experience, even if you don't have any web dev experience. If you are unfamiliar with terms like "variable", "function", or "loop", the beginning of 61d may be a bit too fast paced.
