### What is React?

**React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces (UI).**

Take a look at this webpage. React allows you, the programmer, to build reusable components, like a sidebar, a clickable button, or a paragraph of text, which helps efficiently create interactive UI's.

Take a look at the **[Official React Docs](https://react.dev/learn)**.

### Why React?

- Reusablity and Modularity:

  - React's component-based architecture, allow developers to create **reusable components** that manage their own state. Components are modular and can be easily maintained, tested individually, and reused. (Don't Repeat Yourself!)

<!-- - Declarative UI:

  - Developers only need to describe what the UI should look like for a given state, and React handles the rendering. For example, think about a toggle switch between dark and light mode. -->

- Efficient Updates and Rendering:
  - React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM, React updates a virtual representation of the DOM, which is then used to calculate the most efficient way to update the real DOM.

      <summary>Deep Dive: DOM and Virtual DOM</summary>
    
      The **Document Object Model** (DOM), is the data representation of a web document. representing it as nodes and objects. This way it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
        
    The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. It’s a JavaScript object that React uses to keep track of changes in the UI. When a component’s state changes, React updates the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.

    How does Virtual DOM make React faster?
    1. Batching Updates: React batches multiple updates to the virtual DOM, reducing the number of times the real DOM needs to be updated.

    2. React compares the new virtual DOM to the previous virtual DOM to identify the minimal set of changes required. This process is called _reconciliation._

    3. After identifying the changes, React updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire UI. This _selective rendering_ significantly improves performance, especially for complex UIs.

### But First ... Basic HTML

**Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)**:

- Describes the _structure_ of a webpage
- Consists of a series of HTML elements, which  label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.
- For further reading check out [MDN web docs tutorial-HTML ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

<details>
    <summary>Deep Dive: Hypertext and Markdown</summary>

    **"Hypertext"** refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
    
    HTML uses **"markup"** to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.
    
    HTML markup includes special **"tags"** such as `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`, `<footer>`, `<article>` `<p>`, `<div>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` and many others. 
    
    The syntax of using `<` and `>` tells the compiler that the HTML element is a **tag** and not actual content.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>HTML Example</summary>
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
    
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:
    ![HTML Visualization](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*H0Y0UaNr8Xu7Fxsn7Cf5iQ.png)

    In this case, `<title>Page Title</title>` would be an HTML element, defined by a start tag:`<title>`, your content, and an end tag `</title>`

### JSX: Connecting React to HTML

**What is JSX?**

 JSX (**J**ava**S**cript **X**ML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

**Basic JSX Syntax**:
JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`.

    ```jsx
    // Using a JavaScript expression within JSX
    const name = 'Alice';
    const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
    
    // Rendering the element to the DOM
    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));

    ```

**JSX vs HTML**:
   - **Similarities**: JSX looks almost identical to HTML, making it intuitive for those familiar with HTML.
   - **Differences**:
     - JSX elements must be properly closed (e.g., `<img src="image.jpg" />`).
     - JSX uses camelCase for attribute names (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).

**Creating React Elements with JSX**:
   - **Rendering Elements**: React elements created with JSX are rendered using the `ReactDOM.render` method.
     ```jsx
     const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
     ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
     ```

**Embedding HTML in JSX**:
   - **HTML Elements in JSX**: Any valid HTML element can be used within JSX.
     ```jsx
     const element = (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
         <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
       </div>
     );
     ```

**JSX Transpilation**:
   - **Transformation**: JSX is not valid JavaScript, so it needs to be transformed into JavaScript using a tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
     ```jsx
     const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
     // Transformed to:
     const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
     ```
<details>
    <summary>Deep Dive: React Components vs Elements </summary>
    
     A component is a JavaScript function or class, while an element is what is being returned after compilation of JSX and calling of the `React.createElement` method. That is, the element is created in the Virtual DOM, and during rendering, it is transferred into a standard DOM of a web application; for example turning into a button the user can press.
   
     A component:
- can be a function or a class that receives some data and returns elements, other components, lines, and numbers
- operates based on a life cycle
- can change its state (has mutability)
- works with React hooks.

An element:
- is what components always return;
- is created and does not change (has no mutability), and therefore does not work with React hooks.
