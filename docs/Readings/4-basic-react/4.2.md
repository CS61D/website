   - Functional vs. Class components

2. **Creating and Exporting Components**

   - Creating functional components
   - Exporting components

3. **Importing and Composing Components**
   - Importing components into other components
   - Composing components to build a page

### Components: UI Building Blocks

Components are the reusable building blocks of a React application, defined as _functions_ or _classes_ that return JSX. They allow you to break down the UI into reusable, isolated pieces that can manage their own state and behavior.

For example, code for a button could be turned into a `<Buttons />` component you could render on every page, or multiple times on one page.

As your project grows, you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components shared by the React open source community like Chakra UI and Material UI.

<details>
    <summary>Functional vs. Class Components</summary>

| Functional Components | Class Components |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| JavaScript functions that can receive properties (props) as an argument and return React elements (JSX) for rendering. | JavaScript classes that extend the `React.Component` class.|
Shine in simpler scenarios, embracing a more functional programming approach. |  Preferred for complex components that demand precise control over state and lifecycle behavior.

Here is an example of how you can implement a simple Counter using either a functional component or a class component.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Functional Component Example" label="Functional Component Example" default>
    ```javascript
    // implementing a counter using functional component
    import React, { useState } from "react"; 
    
    const FunctionalComponent = () => { 
        const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
    
        const increase = () => { 
            setCount(count + 1); 
        } 
    
        return ( 
            <div style={{ margin: '50px' }}> 
                <h3>Counter App using Functional Component : </h3> 
                <h2>{count}</h2> 
                <button onClick={increase}>Add</button> 
            </div> 
        ) 
    } 
    
    export default FunctionalComponent; 
```


    
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Class Component Example" label="Class Component Example">
    ```javascript
    // implementing a counter using class component
    import React, { Component } from "react"; 

class ClassComponent extends React.Component { 
	constructor() { 
		super(); 
		this.state = { 
			count: 0 
		}; 
		this.increase = this.increase.bind(this); 
	} 

	increase() { 
		this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); 
	} 

	render() { 
		return ( 
			<div style={{ margin: '50px' }}> 
				<h3>Counter App using Class Component : </h3> 
				<h2> {this.state.count}</h2> 
				<button onClick={this.increase}> Add</button> 

			</div> 
		) 
	} 
} 

export default ClassComponent; 
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs> -->

### Building a Component
Read this quick guide on [creating your first component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) from the official React documentation. It takes you through the basic syntax of defining simple functional components. 

### Importing and Exporting Components

### Activities:

- Create a Header, Footer, and MainContent component
- Compose these components in an App component

### Resources:

- [React Component Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [JavaScript Import/Export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export)
