TypeScript is a popular way to add type definitions to JavaScript codebases!
Writing TypeScript with React is very similar to writing JavaScript with React.

 The key difference when working with a component is that you can provide types for your component’s props. These types can be used for correctness checking and providing inline documentation in editors.


:::tip
Every file containing JSX must use the `.tsx` file extension. This is a TypeScript-specific extension that tells TypeScript that this file contains JSX.

For example, we can add a type describing the title in the MyButton component.

```tsx
function MyButton({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return (
    <button>{title}</button>
  );
}
```

This inline syntax is the simplest way to provide types for a component, though once you start to have a few fields to describe it can become unwieldy. Instead, you can use an interface or type to describe the component’s props:

```tsx
interface MyButtonProps {
  /** The text to display inside the button */
  title: string;
  /** Whether the button can be interacted with */
  disabled: boolean;
}

function MyButton({ title, disabled }: MyButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button disabled={disabled}>{title}</button>
  );
}

```

The type describing your component’s props can be as simple or as complex as you need, though they should be an object type described with either a `type` or `interface`.
