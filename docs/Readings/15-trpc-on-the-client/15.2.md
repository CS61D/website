# 15.2 - Loading and Error States

When working with tRPC on the client side, handling loading and error states effectively is crucial for providing a smooth user experience. React Query, which tRPC integrates with, provides robust tools to manage these states.

## Handling Loading/Error States

In tRPC, loading states indicate that data is being fetched or a mutation is in progress. React Query’s hooks provide a `isLoading` or `isFetching` state to help you manage this.

Error handling is crucial for providing feedback and handling cases where something goes wrong. React Query’s hooks provide a `isError` state to help you manage this.

### Example: Handling Loading/Errors with `useQuery`

```typescript
// src/components/UserProfile.tsx
import { trpc } from "../utils/trpc";

const UserProfile = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
  const {
    data: user,
    isLoading,
    isError,
    error,
  } = trpc.user.getUser.useQuery(id);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user?.name}</h1>
      <p>{user?.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
```

In this example:

- `isLoading` is true while the query is fetching data, and you can show a loading indicator.
- `isError` is true if an error occurred during the query.
- `error.message` provides the error message which you can display to the user.

:::tip
For mutations, React Query provides similar hooks and states to manage loading and error conditions with `useMutation`.
