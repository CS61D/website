Relational databases are one of the most common types of databases. They organize data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Some fundamental concepts are listed below:

**Table**

- **Definition:** A table is a collection of related data entries that consists of columns and rows.
- **Example:** A `Customers` table with columns for `CustomerID`, `Name`, `Email`.

**Row**

- **Definition:** A row, also known as a record or tuple, represents a single data item in a table.
- **Example:** A row in the `Customers` table with data: `1, John Doe, john@example.com`.

**Column**

- **Definition:** A column, also known as a field or attribute, represents a data attribute within a table.
- **Example:** The `Email` column in the `Customers` table.

**Primary Key**

- **Definition:** A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table.
- **Example:** `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table.

**Foreign Key**

- **Definition:** A foreign key is a column that creates a relationship between two tables.
- **Example:** `BuyerID` in the `Orders` table might be a foreign key linking to the `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table.

**Relationships**

- Relationships describe how tables are linked to each other.
- **Cardinality** refers to the numerical relationship between two entities. It specifies the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with an instance of another entity.
- **Relationship Types:**
  - One-to-One
  - One-to-Many
  - Many-to-Many
  - Self-Relationship
