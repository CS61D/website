      **Users Table:**
      | UserID | UserName   |
      |--------|------------|
      | 1      | Alice      |
      | 2      | Bob        |

      **UserProfiles Table:**
      | ProfileID | Bio |
      |-----------|------------------|
      | 1 | "Bio for Alice" |
      | 2 | "Bio for Bob" |

      Here, `UserID` in the `UserProfiles` table is a foreign key that references `UserID` in the `Users` table, illustrating a one-to-one relationship. One user would only have one unique user ID and one unique profile ID.

## One-to-Many

- **Definition:** A row in Table A can have multiple linked rows in Table B.
- **Example:** A `Customer` table and an `Orders` table, where each customer can have multiple orders.

    **Customers Table:**
    | CustomerID | Name         | Email              |
    |------------|--------------|--------------------|
    | 1          | John Doe     | john@example.com   |
    | 2          | Jane Smith   | jane@example.com   |

    **Orders Table:**
    | OrderID | OrderDate | CustomerID |
    |---------|-----------|------------|
    | 101     | 2023-07-01| 1          |
    | 102     | 2023-07-02| 1          |
    | 103     | 2023-07-03| 2          |

    Here, `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table is a foreign key that references `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table, illustrating a one-to-many relationship where each customer can have multiple orders.

</details>

## Many-to-Many

- **Definition:** Rows in Table A can have multiple links to rows in Table B and vice versa.
- **Example:** A `Students` table and a `Courses` table, where each student can enroll in multiple courses and each course can have multiple students.

<details>

    **Students Table:**
    | StudentID | Name     |
    |-----------|----------|
    | 1         | Alice    |
    | 2         | Bob      |

    **Courses Table:**
    | CourseID | CourseName |
    |----------|------------|
    | 101      | Math       |
    | 102      | Science    |

    **Enrollments Table (Junction Table):**
    | StudentID | CourseID |
    |-----------|----------|
    | 1         | 101      |
    | 1         | 102      |
    | 2         | 101      |

    Here, the `Enrollments` table creates a many-to-many relationship between the `Students` and `Courses` tables. Each student can enroll in multiple courses and each course can have multiple students.

</details>

## Self-Referencing Relationship

- **Definition:** A table has a relationship with itself (aka. Recursive Relationship).
- **Example:** An `Employees` table where each employee can have a manager who is also an employee.
