# Bash

A **Shell**, such as Bash (Bourne-Again SHell), or zsh (Z-shell) allows you to interact with your operating system through a command-line. Command line interfaces (CLI) generally allow for enhanced productivity compared to graphical user interfaces (GUI) for many tasks, as interacting via a keyboard is generally quicker and with a mouse. Shell commands are also scriptable, meaning you can more easily automate tasks.

## Setting Up Aliases

Long commands can be cumbersome to remember type out every single time, especially if you run them dozens of times a day. Fortunately, you can `alias` a command to a shorter name. For example, you can alias `git status` to `gs` by updating either your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file on windows or MacOS respectively.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows/bash" default>

    ```bash
    cd ~ # Go to home directory
    touch .bashrc # Create .bashrc file if it doesn't exist
    code .bashrc # Open .bashrc in vscode
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac/zsh">

    ```bash
    cd ~ # Go to home directory
    touch .zshrc # Create .zshrc file if it doesn't exist
    code .zshrc # Open .zshrc in vscode
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then add an alias like so:

```bash
alias gs='git status'
```

After adding an alias to the file, you will need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes. You should nwo be able to use your alias in the terminal.

## Bash Quick Reference

### pwd - Print working directory

```bash
pwd
```

### ls - List current directory contents

```bash
ls
ls -a # List all files including hidden files and dot files like .gitignore
```

### cd - Change directory

```bash
cd path/to/directory
cd .. # Move up one directory
cd ../../ # Move up two directories
cd - # Move to the previous directory
cd ~ # Move to the home directory
```

### touch - Create an empty file

```bash
touch newfile.txt # Create a new file
touch file1.txt file2.txt # Create multiple files
```

### mkdir - Create a new directory

```bash
mkdir newdir # Create a new directory
mkdir -p path/to/newdir # Create a new directory and any necessary parent directories
```

### mv - Move or rename a file

```bash
mv oldname.txt newname.txt # Rename a file
mv myfile.txt newdir/mytextfile.txt # Move a file
```

### cp - Copy a file

```bash
cp myfile.txt newdir/ # Copy a file to a new directory
cp -r mydir newdir/ # Copy a directory to a new directory
```

### rm - Remove a file or directory

```bash
rm myfile.txt # Remove a file
rm -rf mydir # Remove a directory and all its contents
```

### echo - Print text to console

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### cat - Print files to standard output

```bash
cat myfile.txt # Print the contents
```

### history - Show command history

```bash
history
history | tail -n 10 # Show the last 10 commands
```

### tree - Show directory structure

```bash
tree
tree -L 2 # Show the directory structure to a depth of 2
tree -L 2 -I "node_modules" "build" # Show the directory structure to a depth of 2, ignoring node_modules and build directories
tree --gitignore # Automatically ignore all files ignored by git based on a .gitignore file
```

### alias - Create a shortcut for a command

Running the alias command will only create the alias for the current terminal session. To make it accessible in every session, add the alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file as explained in [Setting up aliases](#setting-up-aliases).

```bash
alias gs='git status'
```

You can also use the `which` command to see what a command is aliased to or run `alias` without any arguments to print all of your aliases.

```bash
which gs # gs: aliased to git status
alias # print all aliases in current terminal session
```

### clear - Clear the terminal screen

```bash
clear
```
