# Bash

A **Shell**, such as Bash (Bourne-Again SHell), or zsh (Z-shell) allows you to interact with your operating system through a command-line. Command line interfaces (CLI) generally allow for enhanced productivity compared to graphical user interfaces (GUI) for many tasks, as interacting via a keyboard is generally quicker and with a mouse. Shell commands are also scriptable, meaning you can more easily automate tasks.

## Setting up aliases

Long commands can be cumbersome to remember type out every single time, especially if you run them dozens of times a day. Fortunately, you can `alias` a command to a shorter name. For example, you can alias `git status` to `gs` by updating either your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file on windows or MacOS respectively.

(TODO give instructions)
