# Course Overview

## Why 61D?

After mastering the fundamentals through introductory computer science course, such as [Berkeley's CS61A](https://cs61a.org/) or [Harvard CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), there is no immediately obvious next step a student should take to learn how to build a modern full stack application from design to deployment. Knowledge of functions, conditionals, loops, recursion, and even complex data structures is not enough to actually create and launch a web application. Even after a full computer science degree, there is no guarantee that a student will ever interact with a database, a web server, build any kind of user interface, or deploy to more than an autograder. 

This course bridges that gap. Designed to be taken after a first semester university level computer science course, it teaches an opinionated set of technologies which are widely used in industry to build full stack applications. The course is designed to be taken in a single semester, and is structured to be accessible to students with no prior experience in web development.

## What we cover
The technologies used in the course are inspired by the [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/)

1. **Fundamentals**:
    - **Git**: Industry standard version control.
    - **JavaScript + TypeScript**: The most popular programming language in the world, which is used in all front end applications, and are also widely used in non-performance critical back end applications.
    - **Developer Productivity**: Efficient use of the command line, linters and formatters, the VSCode ecosystem, and basic debugging.
2. **Front End**:
    - **React**: The most popular industry standard method of building front ends.
    - **Tailwind CSS**: A modern CSS framework.
    - **Next JS**: The world's most popular React framework which provides the functionality needed to build full stack applications.
    - **React Query**: Used in one in six of all React applications, React Query is the industry standard way of managing server state in React applications.
3. **Back End**:
    - **tRPC**: A modern type-safe back end framework.
    - **PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM**: The most popular relational database, with the most modern tool for accessing it.
    - **Auth.js**: Open source authentication library allowing use authentication with any OAuth provider.
    - **APIs and Webhooks**: Subscribing to webhooks and using APIs of external services.
4. **Deployment and Infrastructure**:
    - **Managed Deployments with Vercel**: 
    - **Self Hosted Deployment with Docker and Coolify**:
