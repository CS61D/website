# Thing to do, and never do to be a productive typescript developer

Never,
- manually find and replace a variable
- use multiple package managers for the same project

Always
- use a linter and auto formatter
- use control + . to see possible options
- use command + p to search for files
- document key information in readme
- write scripts in package.json
- use a .gitignore file
